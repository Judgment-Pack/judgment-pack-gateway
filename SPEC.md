# Gateway specification

The gateway is the **hosted deployment shape** of the trustworthy-input-acquisition
line ([judgment-pack-evaluator-experiments](https://github.com/Judgment-Pack/judgment-pack-evaluator-experiments),
ADR-0002). It reuses the inline attestation format unchanged and adds exactly one
mechanism on top: a **sealed session registry** that closes the two residuals the
inline verify cannot catch on its own.

**This document is normative for receipt version 2.** It began by deferring the
format to the acquisition-proxy
([`acquisition-proxy/SPEC.md`](https://github.com/Judgment-Pack/judgment-pack-evaluator-experiments/blob/main/acquisition-proxy/SPEC.md)),
which specifies version 1. Version 2 **diverges** from it: receipts and seals are
Ed25519 signatures rather than HMACs, the chain link is `prevSignature` rather than
`prevHmac`, and a receipt carries a `keyId`. A version 1 receipt does not verify
here, and is not accepted — the research artifact keeps its format, this gateway
owns the one that gets deployed and independently implemented.

The reason for the divergence is the property version 1 could not have: verifying an
HMAC requires the key that mints it, so "an independent party can check this" was
never true of version 1. See §4.

## 1. What the inline verify cannot catch

`attest.verify_store` checks every receipt against the public key: signature, key
id, location binding, result re-digest, per-session `callIndex` sequence, and the
`prevSignature` chain. That
makes a store *internally* consistent-or-not. Two attacks leave a store internally
consistent yet not faithful:

- **Whole-session replay.** A genuine session — every receipt validly chained and
  signed under the real key — copied verbatim into another store passes
  `verify_store` there too. Nothing inside a session says *which store it belongs
  to* or *that it is current*.
- **Final-tail rollback.** Deleting the last *k* receipts of a session leaves a
  shorter prefix `0..n-k-1` that is still a valid chain. `verify_store` cannot know
  the session once had more, because the evidence that it did was in the deleted
  receipts.

Both require an anchor **outside** the store: a record of which sessions exist and
how many receipts each finally held, kept by the party that did the attesting and
not forgeable by whoever holds the store.

## 2. The seal

When a session closes, the gateway seals it. A seal is one append-only record:

```
{ "sessionId": <string>, "finalCount": <integer>, "sealedAt": <string>,
  "keyId": <hex>, "signature": <hex> }
```

`signature` = Ed25519, under the gateway's signing seed, over
`"judgment-pack-gateway/seal/2:" + canon({sessionId, finalCount, sealedAt, keyId})`.
The context prefix domain-separates a seal signature from a receipt signature
(`"judgment-pack-gateway/receipt/2:"`) so neither can be replayed as the other.

Checking a seal needs only the **public** key — see §4.

The registry ([`registry.py`](registry.py)) is an append-only file, one seal per
line. Sealing a session that is already sealed is **refused** — a session's
`finalCount` can never be re-sealed to a smaller value, so a seal cannot be walked
backward to excuse a rollback.

## 2a. Session identifiers

A session id names a directory under the store, and a verifier discovers sessions by
**enumerating** that directory. The id is caller-supplied and the caller sits outside
the trust boundary, so it is constrained to a flat token:

```
[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,128}          (and never "." or "..")
```

Anything else — an absolute path, a `..` segment, a nested path — is refused
(`400` over HTTP) before any source runs. This is load-bearing, not hygiene: an id
that escaped the receipts root would produce **genuinely attested, gateway-signed
receipts that verification could never enumerate**, so `/verify` would answer `ok`
for a store missing sessions the gateway had itself signed — silently voiding §3's
coverage guarantee. The store enforces the same rule on write, so the guarantee does
not rest on the HTTP layer alone.

## 3. Registry-anchored verification

`verify_with_registry(verify_store, store_root, key, registry_path, authority)`:

1. Runs `verify_store` (all per-receipt findings carry through unchanged).
2. Loads the seals via `load_seals`, which **drops any seal whose signature does not
   verify** under the public key. A seal forged by someone without the seed is
   discarded, so a store cannot be excused by a forged registry.
3. For each session present in the store:
   - not in the loaded seals → **`unregistered-session`** (whole-session replay, or
     a session forged without the key).
   - store count `<` sealed count → **`tail-rollback`**.
   - store count `>` sealed count → **`count-exceeds-seal`** (receipts beyond the
     seal; a seal is a high-water mark).
4. For each sealed session **absent** from the store → **`sealed-session-missing`**
   (a whole sealed session deleted).

`ok` is true only if the inline verify passed **and** no registry finding fired.

The verifier must obtain the registry from the gateway (the key holder), **not** from
the untrusted store. That is the whole point: the anchor's authority comes from being
outside the store's reach and sealed under a key the store's holder does not have.

## 4. Trust boundary and honest bounds

- The gateway holds **one protected signing identity** (an Ed25519 seed). It lives
  in the service, never in a client or a downstream consumer. A client calls
  `/acquire` and **cannot supply a receipt** — the gateway produces every receipt.
  This is what removes the model/agent from the proof path: a caller can lie about
  facts, but it cannot manufacture the gateway's signature.
- **Verification needs only the public key.** Receipt version 2 signs rather than
  HMACs, so a verifier can check every receipt and seal without holding anything
  that would let it produce one. This is the property that makes independent
  verification meaningful rather than nominal.
- **The public key must arrive out of band.** Fetching it from the gateway under
  audit and then checking that gateway's store proves internal consistency, not
  authenticity: an impostor serves its own key and its own store, and they agree.
  A receipt therefore carries a `keyId` and never a key, so an implementation
  cannot accidentally trust the key a store hands it. Establishing that channel is
  out of scope here.
- A signature still proves only **byte-lineage under an operator-configured
  authority label**: not that a genuinely-named source returned the bytes (the
  recorded `source`/`authority` is a label, not an authenticated origin). The seal
  inherits exactly this — it proves *this key holder sealed this count*, not *this
  count is true of the world*.
- The registry closes whole-session replay and tail rollback **relative to a
  verifier that trusts the gateway's registry over the store**. It does not defend a
  compromised gateway (key disclosure forges anything), and it is a single-identity,
  single-operator reference — not a multi-tenant or federated trust root.
- Scope not claimed: no availability/HA guarantees, no authenticated transport
  (binds localhost), no access control on the HTTP surface. This is a reference for
  self-hosting a trust root and for demonstrating the mechanism, not a hardened
  public deployment.

## 5. HTTP surface (reference)

Localhost, JSON, standard library only.

| Method | Path        | Body / result |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| POST   | `/acquire`  | `{session, source, arguments}` → runs the configured source, attests, chains, retains; returns `{result, receipt}`. No receipt is accepted from the caller. `session` must be a flat token (§2a) or the call is refused `400` before the source runs. |
| POST   | `/seal`     | `{session}` → seals the session's final count; returns the seal record. |
| GET    | `/verify`   | → `{ok, findings}` from `verify_with_registry`. |
| GET    | `/registry` | → the raw registry bytes, for a verifier to fetch the anchor from the key holder. |
| GET    | `/publickey`| → `{algorithm, keyId, publicKey, authority}`. Convenience only — a verifier that obtains the key here and then audits this same gateway has checked consistency, not authenticity (§4). |

A `source` is an operator-configured subprocess that reads the canonical arguments on
stdin and emits a JSON result on stdout. The gateway attaches no transport of its own
— it attests whatever bytes a configured source returns, which is exactly the inline
core's boundary: **proof of the bytes, not proof of their truth.**

## 6. Conformance

An implementation of this specification is checked against the frozen vectors in
[`corpus/`](corpus/README.md), not against the reference's source. Two families:
**canon vectors** (a value → its exact canonical bytes, or a refusal) and **store
vectors** (a complete store and registry → the expected `(ok, findings)`), with one
store vector per status this document names.

`conformance.py` runs them, and defines a small process contract so an
implementation in any language can answer to the corpus without depending on the
reference. Findings are compared as a multiset: **order is not normative.**

Two questions this specification does not yet settle, surfaced by building the
corpus and recorded in [`corpus/README.md`](corpus/README.md): the order of
findings, and whether a receipt that fails verification is *required* to also
produce the `sequence-broken` that follows from its exclusion from the chain
reconstruction. An implementation that differs on either is not thereby
non-conforming; the specification is what needs to improve.

The vectors are signed under a published test seed (`corpus/TEST-SEED`), which signs
nothing real and must never be used by a deployment. Verification consumes only
`corpus/TEST-PUBLIC-KEY` — running the corpus never hands the runner a secret,
which is the same property receipt version 2 gives a real verifier.
